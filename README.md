# Loan-default
**_Please, check my Medium blog post for more details about my analysis here: https://daria-morgan.medium.com/predicting-loan-default-7cc6efc0c6a_**
<br><br>
In this project I wanted to combine my love of finance and data, as well as show off some of my Data Science skills. <br><br>
I chose a dataset from a large European bank that can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview – I chose it because it was massive, messy, and needed plenty of cleaning.<br><br>
I used a variety of techniques such as data cleaning, aggregation with SQL and Python, data visualization, and analysis applying different supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and XGBoost proved to perform better since the dataset had many missing values and the target value was highly imbalanced – the ratio between default customers to non-default was 1/10).<br><br>
I also identified key features that moved the needle as well as created new computed features that helped identify which people would default.
